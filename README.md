# Email-Extractor-from-.mbox-Files

Description: This Go script allows you to extract email addresses from an .mbox file and save them into a simple text file. It's particularly useful for retrieving email addresses from backup files, which can help you track where you've registered your email or to compile a list of contacts.

Usage:

Replace "/your/path/emails.mbox" with the path to your .mbox file.
The script will generate an output.txt file in the same directory, containing all the email addresses found.
